The document in question is a code file titled ""Q-LEARNING CODE.txt."" It contains a Python implementation of the Q-learning algorithm, which is a type of reinforcement learning. The code is structured to initialize parameters for a simulated environment, including the number of states and actions, learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate, and the number of episodes for training. 

### Key Components of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `n_states`: Number of states in the environment (set to 5).
   - `n_actions`: Number of possible actions (set to 3).
   - `alpha`: Learning rate (set to 0.1).
   - `gamma`: Discount factor (set to 0.99).
   - `epsilon`: Exploration rate (set to 0.1).
   - `episodes`: Total number of training episodes (set to 500).
   - `Q`: A Q-table initialized to zeros, which will be updated during training.

2. **Q-Learning Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm runs for a specified number of episodes.
   - In each episode, it starts from a random state and continues until a termination condition is met.
   - It uses an epsilon-greedy strategy to choose actions, balancing exploration and exploitation.
   - The environment's response is simulated, and the Q-values are updated based on the received rewards and the maximum expected future rewards.

3. **Output**: 
   - After training, the final Q-table is printed, showing the learned values for each state-action pair.

### Example Code Snippet:
```python
import numpy as np
import random

# Initialize environment parameters
n_states = 5
n_actions = 3
alpha = 0.1
gamma = 0.99
epsilon = 0.1
episodes = 500

# Initialize Q-table
Q = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))

# Q-Learning algorithm
for episode in range(episodes):
    state = random.randint(0, n_states - 1)
    done = False
    while not done:
        if random.uniform(0, 1) < epsilon:
            action = random.randint(0, n_actions - 1)  # Explore
        else:
            action = np.argmax(Q[state])  # Exploit

        # Simulate environment transition
        next_state = random.randint(0, n_states - 1)
        reward = random.uniform(-1, 1)  # Replace with actual reward logic

        # Update Q-value
        Q[state, action] += alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state]) - Q[state, action])

        # Transition to next state
        state = next_state

        # Example termination condition
        if random.uniform(0, 1) < 0.1:
            done = True

print(""Trained Q-Table (Q-Learning):"")
print(Q)
```
